International sporting events are not just athletic competitions but also ideological competitions between the athletes' nations' cultural, political, and social beliefs. The best example is the 1980 Lake Placid Olympic Games where the Soviet Union took on the United States in the Semi-Final Ice Hockey Match; this game would decide who competed for the Gold Medal. The match also represented the ideological clash between communism and capitalism.

The prestige associated with hosting international sporting events allows the hosting governments to display their cultural, political, and social beliefs to a global audience.

This paper will show how Central Asian Nations are using international sporting events to showcase their unique cultural identities in the post-Soviet context while using the socio- economic prestige associated with hosting international sporting events to convey their importance to the international community. Central Asia has hosted 3 World Championships, 5 World Junior Championships, 24 Regional Championships, and 5 Other Annual International Events. 

Firstly, I discuss Central Asia's different regional hat styles, worn by the performers in each Opening Ceremonies. I will then focus on Saparmurat Turkmenbashy Olympic Stadium in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, and how the government uses the toponymical prestige of the Olympic Games to create the allure of socio-economic progress. Secondly, I examine the 2017 Universiade in Almaty, Kazakhstan and the use of symbols to promote the unique cultural identity of Kazakhstan to a global audience by drawing on the ancient history of Central Asia nomadic people and the future economic prosperity of Kazakhstan. Lastly, I will look at the World Nomad Games. The World Nomad Games are a unique sporting event hosted in Cholpon- Ata, Kyrgyzstan, designed to promote the nomadic lifestyle, culture and tradition of the various nomadic people of Central Asia to a global audience.

##  Traditional Hats

During the Opening Ceremonies, the performers wore a variety of traditional clothing styles of Central Asia.[^i] However, the most distinctive part of the clothing was the numerous different types of hats. The clothes and hats showcase unique color schemes, and embroidery patterns, each of the colors and patterns is specific to a different group of nomadic people from Central Asia. The first hat styles are worn by women; the first type of hat is a headscarf. A headscarf is worn by women for cultural reasons in various styles and colours, although sometimes worn for religious reasons, hijab, head covering worn by some Muslim women.[^ii] The second hat featured was the Shokul, worn during wedding ceremonies.[^iii] The Shokulo is a tall conical hat made of fur and felt decorated with feathers and evil eyes to ward off evil spirits

-- in comparison, the Shokulo for wealthier families includes jewels in addition to feathers and evil eyes.[^iv] Finally, the Elechek combines the conical hat and the headscarf.[^v] The style and amount of fabric used to showcase the family\'s class.[^vi] Upon passing, the fabric used in the Elechek is turned into a funeral shroud.[^vii] The female tribe leader wears the Elechek, mothers who have married all their children, or the bride the first three days following the wedding. The Shokulo is worn during the wedding ceremony and then wrapped in a headscarf by the bride's mother following the wedding.[^viii]

Three different types male hats are ern: the Ak-Kalpak, Turkmen Telpek / Papakha, and Tebeti.[^ix] Men wear the Ak-Kalpak as a demonstration of national pride. The Ak-Kalpak is also a part of the Kyrgyz Olympic Uniform.[^x] Young men wear an Ak-Kalpak with a straight brim and a front notch, while older men have a folded-up brim with no notch.[^xi] The second hat type is the Turkmen Telpek / Papakha, an important symbol of Turkmen identity.[^xii] The Turkmen Telpek / Papakha is the traditional hat of the Caucasus and Turkmen worn in the winter and made out of sheep-wool. The last hat is the Suusar Tebeti for females or Tebeti for males, worn during the winter.[^xiii] The Tebeti is a leather cap with a fur base on the exterior.[^xiv] (See Images 1 - 8)

##  Olympic Complex in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan

World Championships have a high level of social prestige for the athlete and host nation; because there is an implied understanding to the international community that hosting these events requires a level of infrastructure only present in countries from certain economic strata.

Therefore, the host nations spare no expense to dazzle the audience with the design of the competition venues. Few World Championships are more important or prestigious than the Olympic Games. Every four years, three billion-plus casual and serious sports fans gather to cheer on every upset, comeback, and world record, toponymically immortalized with the host city.[^xv]

Turkmenistan hosted the 2017 Asian Indoor Martial Arts Game (AIMAG). Leading up to the event, Turkmenistan built a new multisport athletic complex named after the Olympic Games.[^xvi] Naming the multisport athletic complex after the Olympic Games implies, Turkmenistan has reached the same socio-economic importance as other Olympic host countries. At the same time, they are benefitting from the toponymical prestige associated with hosting an Olympic Games.

The Olympic Complex cost approximately five billion dollars and covered 150- hectares.[^xvii] The Olympic Complex has the competition facilities for the 2017 AIMAG and 2018 World Weightlifting Championships and numerous unnecessary competition venues like the world's largest water-sports complex.[^xviii] To pay for these unnecessary venues, Turkmen have seen a 15 -- 20% drop in their paycheck, reported to western media sources as 'voluntarily deductions' for the 2017 AIMAG.[^xix]

In watching the Opening Ceremonies, I noticed two national symbols, the Seljuk Star design incorporated into the bleachers and the Akhal-Teke horse.[^xx] The spectator bleachers have different colored seats to create a contrasting image of miniature and large Seljuk Stars when not in use. (See Image 9) The Seljuk Star is a symbol dating back to the Seljuq dynasty, the historical ancestors of the Turkmen.[^xxi] The second use was the Akhal-Teke Horse Head adorning Saparmurat Turkmenbashy Olympic Stadium. The Akhal-Teke Horse Head Statue set a new World Record standing 40.05-meters in height (See Image 10).[^xxii] The Akhal-Teke was the preferred breed of horse used by the nomadic ancestors of the Turkmen because of their incredible speed and endurance.[^xxiii] The use of these symbols during the Opening Ceremonies showcases Turkmenistan's depoliticized and dehistoricized identity.[^xxiv]

##  2017 Universiade in Almaty, Kazakhstan


Most Opening Ceremonies follow a traditional format of small opening
performances followed by the entrance of the dignitaries and
presentation of the host nation's flag. Following the flag presentation,
the theatrical performance begins. Following the first performance is
the parade of nations followed by the President, Sporting Official,
Athletes and Judges opening remarks. Then the cultural and historical
performances resume, concluding with the Nations Leader officially
opening the competition.

Like Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan used the 2017 Universiade to raise the
socio-economic importance of their country through hosting international
sporting events. Although Turkmenistan remains optimistic, they will
host the Olympic Games; after naming their newly constructed multisport
athletic complex after the Olympic Games, Kazakhstan has taken a
different approach. After two unsuccessful bids to host the 2014 and
2022 Winter Olympics, Kazakhstan used the 2017 Universiade to showcase
their competition facilities, and management can handle the Olympic
calibre competition.[^xxv]

The 2017 Universiade opens with a group of Kazakh Women playing
Zhetygen, a seven- string instrument and Daulpaz, a traditional drum,
standing on a leaf-shaped stage surrounded by apple trees.[^xxvi] (See
Image 11) On the ice beside the stage are yurts, the traditional homes
of the Kazakh.[^xxvii] As the performance continues, Teutonic Warriors on
horseback enter the stadium with performers dressed in traditional
clothing.[^xxviii] Following the performers are stud horses, which are
horses that the riders perform stunts.[^xxix] Following the opening
addresses and the flag presentation, the theatrical performance
begins.[^xxx] The audience is part of a caravan, the traditional method
of transit for nomadic people; the performance starts with the Kazakh
interpretation of their surroundings and the creation of their core
beliefs shown through the battle between love and evil.[^xxxi] The next
performance was an interpretive bird dance representing the Saka and
Huna people showing that Kazakh history goes back to ancient
times.[^xxxii]

Skipping over the Soviet Period, the next historical era begins with
Nursultan Nazarbayev's reign.[^xxxiii] The final performance contains
four smaller performances. Each of the smaller performances represented
a season, starting with spring. The spring performance represented the
modern architecture (Baiterek Tower), new technologies (different
futuristic clothing designs with new technologies worn by the dancers
instead of their traditional attire (See Image 12)), and aspiration for
a green economy (windmills).[^xxxiv] The summer performance represents
the early development of Kazakhstan's identity after the collapse of the
Soviet Union, with different dances taking place in a yurt representing
the unity between the different nationalities who call Kazakhstan
home.[^xxxv] The different styles of dances taking place in the yurt were
a symbolic representation of the cultural unity in Kazakhstan.[^xxxvi]
Autumn was a representation of Kazakhstan as an emerging center for
creative arts globally.[^xxxvii] Finally, winter represents Kazakhstan\'s
recent successes and future ambitions of the younger
generation.[^xxxviii]

There were three reoccurring symbols throughout the performances used to
promote Kazakh identity: apples, horses, and birds of prey. When the
performance began, the commentators mention the leaf-shaped stage; I
believe the leaf chosen for the stage design was an apple leaf, although
I could not confirm.[^xxxix] In addition to the stage design, the
performers also used apple trees and apples throughout their
performances. Apples are an important symbol in Kazakh culture as they
are one of the most widely cultivated and eaten fruits in the world,
native to the host city Almaty.[^xl] At various points in the Opening
Ceremonies, the performances incorporated horses. Horses are native to
Central Asia and a central part of nomadic culture.[^xli] Birds of prey
were more a thematic element at the games captured through the motto of
the Universiade: Spread Your Wings. Other symbolic representations were
the mascot, a white bird, and a bird-based interpretive dance.[^xlii]
However, I did spot one bird of prey on the arm of a performer, although
it was brief. The inclusion of birds of prey in Universiade showcase the
importance of Salbuurun, the traditional hunting style of Central Asia,
in Kazakhstan Culture.[^xliii] The final performance, which comprises
four smaller performances, showcases a post-Soviet, modern and
Western-friendly Kazakhstan. The invention, use, and investments of
Kazakhstan into new and green technologies. Kazakhstan\'s ambitions to
be an emerging center for the creative arts and, lastly, Kazakhstan's
bright and ambitious future. The final performance showcases Kazakh
modern western friendly identity and ambitions to a global audience.

In "The Art of the Impossible: Political Symbolism, and the Creation of
National Identity and Collective Memory in Post-Soviet Turkmenistan" and
"The monumental and the miniature: imagining 'modernity' in Astana" the
authors discuss the depoliticized and dehistoricized nature of Turkmen
and Kazakhstan identity. The Opening Ceremonies of the 2017 AIMAG and
2017 Universiade continue this theme. Neither Turkmenistan nor
Kazakhstan's Opening Ceremony's

make references to the Soviet Era. The 2017 AIMAG Opening Ceremony
focused on the ethnic Turkmen cheering sections, while the performances
had no explanation for the historical events shown.[^xliv] In the 2017
Universiade, despite having Russian translators, and translations
Kazakhstan only references pre-Soviet and post-Soviet history in their
performances. I have two possible reasons why the Soviet Period was not
part of the performance. Firstly, by showcasing the Soviet era, it only
re-ingrains Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan as part of the Soviet Union into
the audience's mind. Secondly, it is an extension of Gurbanguly and
Nazarbayev\'s domestic efforts to create a depoliticized and
dehistoricized national identity relying on the politicization of
national symbols.[^xlv]

##  2018 World Nomad Games in Cholpon-Ata, Kyrgyzstan

The World Nomad Games were a way to "revive our historical identity,"
said Kanat Amankulov, Kyrgyzstan's minister for youth and sports.[^xlvi]
Through the construction of a hippodrome and the ability to plan,
develop, and successfully host an entirely new type of international
competition, Kyrgyzstan showed their revived national identity and
socio-economic importance to a global audience. The World Nomad Games
are a multisport athletic competition comprising 37 traditional
ethnosports. The primary focus of the World Nomad Games is showcasing
the nomadic culture of Central Asia to a global audience through various
physical and intellectual competitions of different indigenous cultures
primarily from Central Asia and the ongoing Ethno-Cultural Festival.

The festival's goal was to preserve the ethnocultural heritage and
promote nomadic people\'s traditions.[^xlvii] The Ethno-Cultural Festival
allows spectators to watch folk music, folk dance, and listen to various
epics and legends of the nomadic people through oral
storytelling.[^xlviii] The attendees can also stroll through multiple
exhibits showcasing the clothing styles, carpets, jewelry, traditional
housing, et cetera of the nomadic people of Central Asia.[^xlix]

Although not an official part of the Ethno-Cultural Festival, numerous
nations sold different traditional meals throughout the festival
grounds.[^l]

The World Nomad Games held their Opening Ceremonies in a hippodrome,
open-air horse racing track.[^li] The open-air environment gave the World
Nomad Games an additional element of a traditional nomadic feel. The
following day the stage for the ceremony was gone, and the hippodrome
became part of the competition grounds.

The Opening Ceremony follows a theatrical performance of the Epic of
Manas, an epic poem that provides the historical linkage between the
Kyrgyz and their land.[^lii] According to some scholars, the poem dates
back to at least the 15 or 16th century, although the Kyrgyz believe it
to be much older.[^liii] The Epic is an important symbol of perseverance
for the Kyrgyz as it was banned in schools during the Soviet Era because
it promoted expressions of backwardness, tribalism and
traditionalism.[^liv] Despite the ban, the Epic survived through the oral
storytelling of the shepherds and hunters living in the rural regions of
Kyrgyzstan out of reach of Soviet Influence.[^lv] The Epic of Manas is a
trilogy about Manas and his descendants, Smetey and his grandson Seytek,
feats of heroism and unity.[^lvi] (See Annex for Summary of the Epic
Poem) During the Opening Ceremonies, the theatrical performances of the
Epic of Manas used stud horses and birds of prey to further showing the
historical interconnectedness of the nomadic people, Salbuurun,
traditional hunting style of the nomadic people, and horses. ^lvii]

There were 37 traditional ethnosports competed in by 2000 athletes from
77 different countries.[^lviii] The athletes competed in their
traditional clothing in eight different disciplines: Archery using
Traditional Bows; Traditional Hunting, Salbuurun; Traditional types of
Wrestling; Traditional types of Martial Arts; Horse Games; Horse Racing;
Traditional Games; and Traditional Intellectual Games.[^lix] (See Table
1) These athletic disciplines best showcase how the

World Nomad Games promote nomadic culture to a global audience; I will
further explain Salbuurun and the horse-related disciplines.[^lx]

Salbuurun is the traditional style of long group hunting. Hunting
parties consisted of the tribe\'s most talented riders. The hunters
carried bows and arrows along with the best falcons, golden eagles, and
hunting dogs.[^lxi] At the World Nomad Game, Salbuurun is competed in
three different disciplines: Burkut Saluu, Dalba, and Taigan Zharysh.
Burkut Saluu is a two-part competition for hunting with eagles.[^lxii]
The first part is Undok which is a 200-meter distance race.[^lxiii] The
bird sits on a perch 200 meters away from the master, who holds a piece
of bait.[^lxiv] The master has 2 minutes to call the eagle from the
perch; the score is calculated based on the time it takes for the bird
to arrive.[^lxv] The second part is Chyrga; this requires the master's
eagle to catch a fox dummy dragged behind a horse; the eagle\'s time and
speed to attack the dummy is the second part of the score.[^lxvi] Dalba
is a three-minute competition that requires the master to launch their
falcon to hunt a lure made of bird feathers.[^lxvii] The average speed
and the number of attacks on the lure over the three minutes is the
winner. Taigan Zharysh is the competition for dog hunting.[^lxviii] A
horse pulls a fox or hare dummy while three dogs try to catch the
dummy.[^lxix] The winner is the fastest dog over 350 meters.[^lxx]

Horses compete in two different disciplines: games and traditional
racing plus horse archery. There are two different types of horse games
played at the World Nomad Games Er- Enish and Kok-Boru. Er-Enish is
horseback belt wrestling. The objective of Er-Enish is to be the first
person to pull their opponent off their horse and have their opponent
touch the ground.[^lxxi]

Er-Enish developed from the hand-to-hand combat experience of the
nomadic people and later intergraded into Kyrgyz Calvary's training
regiment.[^lxxii] The first mention of Er-Enish is in the Epic of
Manas.[^lxxiii]

Kok-Boru, translated as Grey Wolf, has multiple different origins
tales.[^lxxiv] The first comes from the traditional hunting practices of
Salbuurun, where after a successful hunter would grab the carcass, they
would begin racing home, the rest of the hunting party would chase the
carcass carrying hunter try to steal the carcass off the back of their
horse.[^lxxv] The second origin tales of Kok-Boru comes from the nomadic
hunters who were furious that wolves attacked their flock upon returning
to camp after a hunting expedition.[^lxxvi] So the hunters would take off
on horseback, catching up with the pack of wolves; once they caught up
with the pack of wolves, one of the bravest hunters' would grab a wolf
and playfully throw it to each other.[^lxxvii] The last origin tale comes
from the celebration of toy (great holiday). During toy, the nomadic
people would set a wolf loose in front of a group of men who would race
to capture the wolf. Once the wolf was caught, they would attempt to
steal the wolf from each other to be the first person to deliver the
wolf to the elder's yurt.[^lxxviii] Once the competition was over, the
winner would receive blessings and a baige (prize).[^lxxix] The modern
game uses a headless goat instead of the traditional wolf carcass. The
goats' death is part of a huge celebration filled with prayers the night
before the competition.[^lxxx] A Kok-Boru match consists of two teams of
ten players on horseback; the objective is to get the goat carcass into
the hole in the opponents\' end; the winner is the team with the most
points at the matchs' end.[^lxxxi]

Lastly, there are various types of horse racing based on the age and
breed of the horses covering various distances and terrains. Horse
racing was a part of cultural celebrations and a method of conflict
resolution between tribes. Horse racing has been a highly social and
political part of nomadic culture, with mentions of horse racing in the
Epic of Manas.[^lxxxii]

##  Conclusion

These Opening Ceremonies show how Central Asian Countries have used the
intersectionality of politics, culture and international sporting events
to showcase their unique

cultural identities while raising their socio-economic status in the
international community. The first way the Former Soviet Republic
expressed their unique cultural identity was through the traditional
hats worn by the performers at the opening ceremonies. The most popular
style worn by the female performers was the Shokulo, while the most
popular style worn by the male performers was the Turkmen Telpek /
Papakha.

The second way international sporting events help boost the
socio-economic status of the Former Soviet Republics is by providing
them with the opportunity to become the location of sports-based
collective memories, which toponymically immortalize the host city. For
example, Turkmenistan's Saparmurat Turkmenbashy Olympic Complex was
constructed for the 2017 AIMAG and 2018 World Weight Lifting
Championships held in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan. By naming the athletic
venue the 'Olympic Complex,' Turkmenistan implies they hosted or will
the Olympic Games, artificially raising the socio-economic importance of
Turkmenistan to the international community.

The third way is through symbols. Kazakhstan used the journey of a
caravan, the traditional method of transit for nomadic cultures, to take
the audience through a journey of Kazakh history and into their
ambitions for the future. Kazakhstan showcased their cultural identity
to the global community through apples, horses, and birds of prey, which
are important symbols of Kazakhstan and Central Asia.

The last and most unique way international sporting events promote
socio-economic progress in Central Asia is the World Nomad Games. The
World Nomad Games began with the theatrical performance of the Epic of
Manas; the Epic is important for two reasons. First, it provides the
historical linkage between the Kyrgyz and their land and symbolizes
perseverance against the Soviet Union's attempts to suppress ethnic
tradition in Central Asia. Secondly, the

World Nomad Games consisted of 37 traditional ethnosports divided into
eight disciplines. I chose to elaborate further on the origins of
salbuurun and the horse-related disciplines to show how the nomadic
lifestyle is intertwined with horses and Salbuurun. I also choose these
disciplines as all of the Opening Ceremonies have used salbuurun and
horses to showcase the linkages between their pre and post-Soviet
identities to a global audience.

Annex 1 -- Summary of the Epic of Manas^lxxxiii]

The legends and folk stories are set in the period when the Kyrgyz were exiled from their native lands in the Lake Baikal area of present-day Russia by Chinese warriors and moved to the Altai territory, where present-day Russia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia and China all come together. It was here that Manas was born. From an early age he displayed extraordinary abilities and feats of strength and got himself into various scrapes due to his propensity to mischief and generosity. His fame spread far beyond the Altai. When the Chinese emperor heard about Manas's strengths sent an army of warriors to kill him, Manas managed not only to smash the Chinese, he united the Kyrgyz and regained their native lands. Thus, for the Kyrgyz people Manas is the legendary hero who united all Kyrgyz tribes to win back their motherland.

Manas's son Semetey was a great warrior too. After Manas death, his wife Kanykei and with her son moved back with her parents. Semetey grew up not knowing that he was a son of a legendary hero. Once he realized the truth about his origin, Semetey decided to regain Kyrgyz lands and avenge the death of his father. Semetey and his friends performed many acts of bravery. But his enemies conspired against him and eventually prevailed. The second part of Kyrgyz Epic Trilogy ends with Semetey's disappearance.

The Manas' third part "Seytek" deals with Kyrgyz's struggle against local enemies. It is narrates the struggles and adventures of the Seytek, grandson of Manas and is a continuation of the narrative unveiled in previous parts. The story includes Seytek's upbringing in the camp of his father's enemy; his unawareness of his origin; his maturation into a great hero; the discovery of the truth about his origin; the expulsion of his enemies; his return to his people; and the unification of the Kyrgyz and restoration of peace.
